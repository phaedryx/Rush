I like the javascript SyntaxHighlighter written by Alex Gorbatchev 
(http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter) by I didn't care 
for the treatment of Ruby.  I decided to write my own Ruby "brush" 
and a matching theme that is ruby-centric.

* shBrushRuby.js - this file replaces the ruby brush in the "scripts" directory
* shThemeRush.css - add this file to the "styles" directory
* highlighter-test.html - I used this to see how the brush/theme looked
